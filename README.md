## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nathan Rapport. I build tools, libraries, and systems, with an eye toward speed and simplicity. 

My programming interests span algorithms, compilers, language design, information retrieval, distributed systems, cryptography/cryptocurrency, formal methods (TLA+), and AIâ€”particularly where neural models intersect with ranking, retrieval, and system design.
